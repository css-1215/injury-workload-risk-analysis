# Injury Workload & Risk Monitoring Analysis

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world sports analytics workflow to monitor injury burden and identify players at elevated risk using interpretable metrics.

The analysis was conducted end-to-end using Excel, SQL (SQLite), and Python, following professional data analyst best practices including data validation, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Business Problem
Injuries result in lost availability and performance decline.  
This analysis aims to:
- Quantify injury burden across teams and time
- Identify players with elevated injury risk
- Support proactive workload and availability decisions

## Data
Publicly available injury and team performance dataset used to simulate professional injury monitoring systems.

## Tools Used
- Excel (initial exploration and validation)
- SQL (SQLite) for querying and aggregation
- Python (pandas, matplotlib) for cleaning, analysis, and visualization

## Key Outputs (to be completed)
- Cleaned and validated dataset
- Injury burden KPIs
- Player risk scoring framework
- Executive summary with recommendations
